# Custom Pull-to-Refresh Animation with [Rive](https://rive.app/) in Flutter

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/190afde9-f818-448a-b11a-8465376b1ff3

This Flutter project demonstrates a custom pull-to-refresh animation using Rive and its state machines to reflect different states during the pull-to-refresh process. The project integrates Rive's powerful animation capabilities to create a smooth and visually appealing refresh interaction.

## Features

Custom Pull-to-Refresh: The pull-to-refresh interaction is animated with a Rive animation.
State Machines: Rive state machines are used to reflect different states of the pull-to-refresh, such as "idle," "pulling," "refreshing," and "completed."
Smooth Integration: The Rive animation is smoothly integrated with Flutter's RefreshIndicator.
